<p>
Mental health is a vital component of our overall well-being. It encompasses our emotional, psychological, and social health, affecting how we think, feel, act, and relate to others. A mentally healthy person is better equipped to cope with stress, work productively, and contribute to their community.
<br> <br>
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders—it’s a state of well-being where individuals realize their potential, handle life's stresses, and function effectively in society.

Common Mental Health Challenges<br><br>

Mental health issues range from temporary stress responses to long-term psychiatric conditions. <br>Common disorders include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Depression: Characterized by persistent sadness, hopelessness, fatigue, and loss of interest in activities.</li>

<li>Anxiety Disorders: Involve excessive worry, restlessness, and physical symptoms like a racing heart.</li>

<li>Bipolar Disorder: Features dramatic mood swings between high-energy “manic” states and deep depressive episodes.</li>

<li>Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD): Includes intense emotional instability, impulsivity, and fear of abandonment.</li>

<li>Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD): Primarily affects children with chronic irritability and severe temper outbursts. </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Each disorder requires specific types of care and support. Early intervention is critical in improving long-term outcomes.</p>

Mood swings are sudden or intense changes in emotional states like moving quickly from happiness to irritability or sadness. Everyone experiences mood shifts occasionally, but when they’re frequent or extreme, they may signal an underlying issue.
<br>
Causes of Mood Swings:<br>


<ul>
<li>Hormonal fluctuations (puberty, PMS, menopause)</li>

<li>Stress and sleep deprivation</li>

<li>Poor diet or lack of physical activity</li>

<li>Mental health disorders (bipolar disorder, depression, BPD)</li>

<li>Substance use or medication side effects</li>
</ul>
<h6 style="font-size: smaller;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Cleveland Clinic and Verywell Health</h6>
<br>
<p>Some mood swings are temporary and situational (e.g., stress before an exam), while others may be symptoms of deeper, ongoing psychological conditions.</p>


</p> <br><br>
<h2> Mood Swings in Adolescents: Normal or Concerning? </h2>
<p>

<br><br>

Teenagers are especially prone to emotional ups and downs. A 2024 review in the Indian Journal of Child Health states that up to 80% of adolescents experience noticeable mood shifts due to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Hormonal changes</li>

<li>Identity development</li>

<li>Social pressure</li>

<li>Academic stress</li>
</ul>
</p> <br><br>


 
<h2> When to Seek Help? </h2>
<p><br><br>

It’s time to consider professional support if:<br>

<ul>
<li> Mood swings interfere with daily functioning
</li>
<li>You feel persistently overwhelmed, hopeless, or empty</li>

<li>Relationships are impacted by unpredictable emotions</li>

<li>You have thoughts of self-harm or suicide</li>
</ul>

<p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) emphasizes that mental illness is treatable. Therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes can significantly improve quality of life.</p></p>
